**All screens**, except 1A contain a question mark on top right. This question-mark should open a webbrowser and go to url: https://www.eduvpn.org

### Screen 1B - First screen when used App before 
This screen is shown when app starts and user has authorised in earlier phase. When clicking on "Add Other Server" the app should go to screen 1A. Via this screen the user should be able to add more VPN servers  to screen 1B.

When an user has already authenticated for a single secure internet server, he is able to connect to the  other countries as well! The "change location" button should view the other countries to which the VPN client could connect.

 ### Screen 3A - search results
 When an user in screen 1C types a few characters, he should get search results from the new discovery for both secure internet  and institute access usecases. The 'found' results are clickable and should trigger an authentication session in the webbrowser.

 ### Screen 3B - add a host-name
 As soon as an user is typing "two dots" in screen 3A, which indicates he wants to connect to a specific hostname, screen 3B should be shown.  The removal of the "two dots" should go back to screen 3A.
