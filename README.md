# Country Code Mapping

The file `country_code_to_country_mapping.json` contains a mapping from country
code to country and contains some translations of the country names as well to
local languages.

It is a JSON version of an OpenStreetMap document found 
[here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Country_Codes).

Maybe there are better, i.e. more complete lists available, but this is what
I found by browsing the web.

**NOTE**: [this](http://www.foreignword.com/countries/English.htm) also looks
like an interesting resource.
